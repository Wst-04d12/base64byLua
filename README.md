# base64byLua
A simple base64 implementation by Lua.  
Using LuaJIT as Runtime.  
  
Mode 1 uses stdin as input and write the output to output.txt and print it into console[optional].  
Mode 2 uses input.txt as input instead of stdin.  
  
Select the Mode first, and then Encode or Decode.  
  
The result will write to the output.txt anyway, if you want to keep the previous result, manually save it to a proper location.
